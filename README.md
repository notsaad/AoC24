# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions in C++
### Running from Dec 1 - Dec 25 each day consists of 2 coding problems, solutions will be hosted here.

Doing problems in C++ because I think it's a fun language (Python would definitely be easier lol). <br>
UPDATE: i switched to python because it was in fact, much easier
